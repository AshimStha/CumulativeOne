**Overview**

This documentation outlines the server-rendered cycles that occur when a teacher is added or removed from the system. The process involves handling both the addition and removal scenarios separately.

## Teacher Addition

When a teacher is added, the process commences with user interaction through the application interface. Users input relevant teacher information in a designated form. Client-side validation follows, ensuring that the entered data is valid and meets the required criteria. Once client-side validation succeeds, the form is submitted to the server through a specific endpoint or route.

Upon receiving the form data, the server performs server-side validation to guarantee data integrity and adherence to business rules. This step includes checks for duplicate entries and other constraints. After successful validation, the server interacts with the database to store the validated teacher information, creating a new teacher record.

Subsequently, the server updates the relevant views or templates to reflect the addition of the new teacher. This may involve reloading specific sections of the page or triggering partial updates using asynchronous techniques like AJAX.

## Teacher Removal

To remove a teacher, users interact with the application by selecting the teacher to be removed and confirming the action. A confirmation step may be included to prevent accidental removal, presented as a modal dialog or a separate confirmation page.

Once confirmation is received, a request is sent to the server to initiate the teacher removal process. The server, in turn, processes the removal request by deleting the corresponding teacher record from the database.

Following the database interaction, the server updates the relevant views or templates to reflect the removal of the teacher. This ensures that the user interface accurately represents the current state of the system, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive documentation covers the intricacies of the server-rendered cycles involved in adding or removing a teacher from the system in the C# ASP.NET web app. The detailed explanation encompasses user interactions and the server-side processes required to maintain data consistency and deliver an intuitive and coherent user experience.
